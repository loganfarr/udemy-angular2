# udemy-angular2
<p>A repository that I can reference the project built through the Udemy course "Angular 2 with TypeScript for Beginners: The Pragmatic Guide"</p>

<p>In this course, we created a test project as our "final project" that pulls test content from jsonplaceholder.typicode.com to render users, posts, and comments onto a page. It also uses filtering and pagination.</p>

<p>This repository is primarily meant to be an accessible reference for mysekf during my future Angular2 endevours. While I did work on this project, I was guided through it by the instructor, Mosh Hamedani, and is not a true reflection of my skill alone.</p>

<p>Please <a href="mailto:logan@loganfarr.com">contact me</a> if you have any questions about this respository.</p>
